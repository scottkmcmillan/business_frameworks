### ruv-FANN
[ruv-FANN](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruv-FANN)

### ruv-FANN Summary
These models are designed to learn complex, non-linear patterns in sequential data, capturing trends, seasonality, and shifting behavior across time. Unlike traditional statistical methods, deep models adapt to change, handle multiple inputs, and produce far more accurate and probabilistic forecasts. That’s critical when you’re making decisions in fast-moving systems.

On the practical side, it’s perfect for retail demand planning, trading platforms, smart grid forecasting, and logistics optimization. On the more exotic end, I’m using it in agentic reflection loops, autonomous swarm control, and recursive planning pipelines inside zero-person businesses. Anything that requires complex decisions made instantly that can evolve overtime.

It gives you a way to go from concept to decision in milliseconds, enabling adaptive agents, swarm-based systems, or autonomous infrastructures to operate with zero lag between signal and response.

Neuro Divergent (a piece of this project) mirrors the NeuralForecast Python API but runs dramatically faster. Training is 2–4× quicker. Inference is 3–5× faster. Memory usage drops by about a third. 

Built entirely in Rust, it compiles to fast, safe binaries with async-native pipelines, zero-copy memory, and SIMD acceleration. The architecture is modular, cleanly separated crates for data, models, training, and orchestration. 

ruv-FANN is a complete rewrite of the Fast Artificial Neural Network (FANN) library in pure Rust, providing memory safety, performance, and modern developer experience. Key features include:

- **Memory Safety**: Zero unsafe code, eliminating segfaults and memory leaks common in C-based ML libraries
- **Performance**: Native Rust speed with potential for SIMD acceleration and zero-cost abstractions
- **Developer Friendly**: Idiomatic Rust APIs with comprehensive error handling and type safety
- **FANN Compatible**: Drop-in replacement for existing FANN workflows with familiar APIs

The project includes **Neuro-Divergent**, an advanced neural forecasting library built on the ruv-FANN foundation that provides:

- **27+ Neural Models**: Complete forecasting model library including LSTM, NBEATS, Transformers, DeepAR
- **Python API Compatibility**: Drop-in replacement for NeuralForecast with identical API
- **Superior Performance**: 2-4x faster training and inference than Python implementations
- **Memory Efficiency**: 25-35% reduced memory usage with Rust optimizations

ruv-FANN excels in various applications including classification & recognition, prediction & forecasting, research & education, and production systems, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

### What is FANN?
FANN (Fast Artificial Neural Network Library) is a free, open-source neural network library that implements multilayer artificial neural networks in C with support for both fully connected and sparsely connected networks. Originally developed by Steffen Nissen and released around 2003, FANN is designed to be fast, versatile, and easy to use.

Key characteristics include:

- **Speed and Efficiency**: Optimized for performance, suitable for real-time applications and resource-constrained environments
- **Multiple Training Algorithms**: Supports various training algorithms including backpropagation, resilient propagation (RPROP), and quickprop
- **Network Architectures**: Supports feed-forward neural networks with multiple hidden layers and various activation functions
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Written in C, highly portable across many operating systems and hardware platforms
- **Bindings for Multiple Languages**: Has bindings for numerous programming languages including Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, and others
- **Fixed and Floating-Point Support**: Works with both fixed-point and floating-point arithmetic, suitable for embedded systems
- **Cascade Training**: Includes support for cascade training algorithms that can automatically determine the appropriate network architecture
