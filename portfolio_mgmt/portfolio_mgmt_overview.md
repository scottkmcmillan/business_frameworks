# Product Portfolio Management Overview

Portfolio management is an important aspect of business operations and success, much like how logistics serve as a coordination hub for goods, product portfolio management orchestrates the movement of activities required to effectively deliver and support products. This management approach involves coordinating multiple product lines, managing resources, and ensuring efficient distribution channels. Like a complex ecosystem of planes, ships, railways, trucks and intermodal connections, a product portfolio requires careful coordination of development, operations and distribution networks. Success depends on ensuring value delivery, optimizing throughput, maintaining quality standards, and adapting to changing market conditions while ensuring sustainable resource utilization.
