# Organizational Structure

The business's product portfolio consists of four different member-facing experiences: 
1. Coaching Experiences
2. Community Experiences
3. Spaces Experiences
4. Team-Wellbeing Experiences

Every year a series of programs are executed to improve each of those product experiences based on the account's objectives and priorities. 

The program delivery, operations and service delivery for each member experience are managed by the following functions:  

- Operations management 
- Product, data and technology management
- Community and event development
- Marketing and Communications development
- Hospitality development
- Regional Service delivery

Those business functions are led by account, center of excellence (COE) and regional leadership teams.

## Account Leadership

Through a multi-year contracting process and ongoing client management, Account Leadership negotiates the scope of work and the organization's structure. Account Leadership is then responsible for defining the account's strategy, objectives and priorities based on the client's business needs. 

## Center of Excellence (COE)

Based on the account's priorities and objectives, the COE drives the account's annual plan. The COE then provides the resources, expertise, guidance, standardization, training programs and best practices for all regional business units in the account. Key responsibilities include:

### Strategic Leadership
- Develop and maintain standardized service delivery frameworks

- Establish best practices for the development and delivery of the portfolio's member experiences

### Annual Planning
The COE proposes an annual plan consisting of a drafted SD, Marcomm, Product Release (implementation) and COE program calendar. And the associated budget. Once agreed upon and approved by all stakeholders, the annual plan governs the work done by the COE for the year. 

The annual plan is based on an extensive annual business review and input gathering from regional and COE Google stakeholders in addition to Exos SD. Although changes to the annual plan are to be accomodated, the primary way of working is to gain alignment before the year and not intake new initiatives on a quarterly basis that draw away focus and resources from the established priorities. 

### Continual Improvement
The COE with SD cooperation will have continual improvement processes to refine the experiences being delivered. In addition to supporting the regions with unforeseen issues and opportunities.
