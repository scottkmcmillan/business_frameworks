# Organizational Structure
## Matrix Model

The following organizational structure is based on a matrix model. In a matrix model, the COE is a central hub with multiple functions. Each of those functions connect to one or more products (i.e. Coach, Community, Spaces or Teams member experiences) delivered by the regional service delivery teams. 

Both the COE and the regional service delivery teams are managed by the **account leadership**.

The COE provides a central hub of expertise and resources, supporting regional service delivery teams in several ways:

## Provides standardized frameworks and best practices: 
The COE develops and disseminates standardized frameworks for service delivery, program design, marketing, and other key functions. These frameworks provide a foundation for consistency and quality across all regions while allowing for local adaptations.   

## Offers specialized expertise and training: 
The COE houses experts in various domains, such as fitness programming, nutrition, and community outreach. These experts provide training, guidance, and support to regional teams, ensuring that they have the knowledge and skills to deliver high-quality services.   

## Facilitates knowledge sharing and collaboration: 
The COE fosters communication and collaboration between different departments and regions, breaking down silos and promoting cross-functional learning. This ensures that best practices and innovations are shared across the organization.   

## Develops and shares resources and tools: 
The COE creates and distributes resources, such as training materials, marketing templates, and operational guides, to support regional teams in their work. This helps to ensure consistency and efficiency in service delivery.   

## Monitors performance and provides feedback:
The COE tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) for both the COE and regional teams, providing feedback and guidance to help improve service delivery and achieve organizational goals.
