# Strategic Alignment Pyramid
The strategic alignment pyramid describes the alignment between mission, strategy, priorities, annual objectives, and initiatives as a hierarchical structure. The mission is at the top, followed by the strategy to achieve the mission. Priorities are focus areas for the team to achieve the strategy and mission. Annual objectives are near-term goals based on these priorities, and initiatives are what the organization executes in order to meet the annual objectives. This structure empowers leadership to prioritize programs and allocate resources while providing focus and direction for the team.
