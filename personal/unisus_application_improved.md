Financial Scholarship Application - Personal Statement

I am writing to apply for the athlete-scholar scholarship program at Unisus for my son Levi. 

While I am fortunate to have a good income at present, our family's financial journey has been one of substantial change, calculated risks and long-term vision for both our family and professional aspirations.

Seventeen years ago, Sarah and I made the deliberate choice to leave well-established careers in the United States to return to Canada and put down roots in Penticton. This decision, while optimal for our family's quality of life, came with significant financial implications. The Okanagan Valley, while rich in so many ways, did not offer the same career opportunities in our field, resulting in several years of limited income.

As a result of the limited opportunities, for eight of the past eleven years, I dedicated myself to starting and operating an investor backed technology startup. As a founder, I made the strategic decision to maintain my salary below market value to extend our company's operational runway and maximize its chances of success. Despite best efforts, external factors including technological challenges, a volatile startup investment climate, and the unprecedented impact of the pandemic led to the closing of the company. This venture, while providing invaluable experience, did not yield a financial return. 

The Unisus athlete-scholar program represents an exceptional opportunity that aligns perfectly with Levi's potential and our family's values. As a proud Dad, I believe he shows promising talent in STEM subjects, athletics and leadership. I believe the Unisus program could provide him with the structured environment needed to pursue his potential. However, without scholarship support, enrolling Levi in this holistic program would be financially unfeasible for us at this time.

Even with substantial scholarship assistance, funding Levi's tuition will require me to reduce my retirement plan contributions and re-think my financing strategy for starting a new technology company. Despite these financial considerations, I am committed to providing Levi with this educational opportunity, as I believe it will significantly impact his future opportunities in both academics and athletics. 

I appreciate your consideration of our application for financial assistance, which would help make this exceptional educational opportunity accessible for Levi while allowing our family to maintain financial stability in the future.
