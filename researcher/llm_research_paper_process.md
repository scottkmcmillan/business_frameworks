# STRATEGIC RESEARCH INSIGHTS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS FOR LLMs

## OVERVIEW

This document outlines a step-by-step process for Large Language Models to follow when creating high-quality research insight papers. The process aligns with established consulting frameworks and is optimized for the unique strengths of LLM thinking patterns. Each phase includes specific thinking prompts designed to guide the LLM through a structured analysis process.

## PHASE 1: PROBLEM FRAMING AND RESEARCH DESIGN

### Step 1: Context Mapping
- **Thinking Prompt**: "Before diving into analysis, construct a mental map of the problem space. What is the broader context in which this research question exists? What are the known elements and what remains uncertain?"
- **Framework Application**: Apply McKinsey's MECE principle to categorize the problem space
- **Output**: A structured overview of the research context

### Step 2: Hypothesis Formulation
- **Thinking Prompt**: "Formulate 3-5 clear, testable hypotheses about this topic. What specific patterns or relationships do you anticipate finding? What would contradict these expectations?"
- **Framework Application**: Use the SCQA (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer) structure
- **Output**: A set of well-defined hypotheses to guide research

### Step 3: Research Architecture Design
- **Thinking Prompt**: "Design an issue tree that breaks down the main research question into component sub-questions. How do these questions relate to each other? What information is needed to answer each one?"
- **Framework Application**: Apply McKinsey's Issue Tree methodology
- **Output**: Structured research plan with clear information requirements

## PHASE 2: INFORMATION GATHERING AND SYNTHESIS

### Step 4: Knowledge Base Assessment
- **Thinking Prompt**: "What do I already know about this topic with high confidence? What information might be outdated or uncertain? What are the critical gaps in my knowledge base?"
- **Framework Application**: Apply Gartner's Information Quality Matrix
- **Output**: A self-assessment of knowledge strengths and limitations

### Step 5: Pattern Recognition
- **Thinking Prompt**: "Looking across multiple domains and sources, what recurring patterns emerge? What anomalies stand out? What temporal trends can be identified?"
- **Framework Application**: Use Gartner's Pattern Recognition Methodology
- **Output**: Identified patterns, trends, and anomalies relevant to the research

### Step 6: Multi-Perspective Analysis
- **Thinking Prompt**: "Analyze this topic from at least three distinct stakeholder perspectives. How do their interests, priorities, and viewpoints differ? Where do they align?"
- **Framework Application**: Apply EY's Multi-Dimensional Value Analysis
- **Output**: A comprehensive stakeholder perspective analysis

## PHASE 3: INSIGHT DEVELOPMENT

### Step 7: Root Cause Analysis
- **Thinking Prompt**: "For each identified pattern or trend, analyze at least three levels of causation. Ask 'why' repeatedly to move beyond surface observations. Distinguish between correlation and causation."
- **Framework Application**: Use Deloitte's Root Cause Analysis Framework
- **Output**: Deep causal understanding of key trends and patterns

### Step 8: Strategic Impact Assessment
- **Thinking Prompt**: "What are the first, second, and third-order consequences of these findings? How might they impact different stakeholders? What are the market, operational, and strategic implications?"
- **Framework Application**: Apply the Strategic Impact Assessment framework
- **Output**: Comprehensive impact analysis across multiple dimensions

### Step 9: Opportunity Identification
- **Thinking Prompt**: "Based on the insights generated, what specific opportunities emerge? Categorize these by timeframe (immediate, medium-term, long-term) and implementation difficulty."
- **Framework Application**: Use Deloitte's Innovation Opportunity Mapping
- **Output**: Structured set of actionable opportunities

## PHASE 4: RECOMMENDATION DEVELOPMENT

### Step 10: Recommendation Prioritization
- **Thinking Prompt**: "Evaluate each potential recommendation against four criteria: impact potential, implementation feasibility, resource requirements, and stakeholder acceptance. Rank them accordingly."
- **Framework Application**: Apply the Recommendation Hierarchy System
- **Output**: Prioritized list of recommendations with clear rationale

### Step 11: Implementation Pathway Design
- **Thinking Prompt**: "For each key recommendation, develop a high-level implementation roadmap. What are the critical steps, potential barriers, and key success factors?"
- **Framework Application**: Use Deloitte's Strategic Roadmap Approach
- **Output**: Implementation pathways for key recommendations

### Step 12: Risk and Mitigation Analysis
- **Thinking Prompt**: "For each recommendation, identify at least three potential risks or unintended consequences. Develop specific mitigation strategies for each."
- **Framework Application**: Apply the Risk Mitigation Framework
- **Output**: Comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## PHASE 5: STRUCTURED COMMUNICATION

### Step 13: Narrative Architecture
- **Thinking Prompt**: "Design the overarching narrative structure of the report. What is the central story? How do the individual sections contribute to this narrative? What is the logical flow from start to finish?"
- **Framework Application**: Apply McKinsey's Pyramid Principle
- **Output**: Coherent narrative structure for the report

### Step 14: Executive Summary Crystallization
- **Thinking Prompt**: "Distill the entire analysis into a concise executive summary that captures the situation, complication, key insights, and recommendations in 250-300 words."
- **Framework Application**: Use the SCQA Executive Summary Framework
- **Output**: Compelling executive summary that stands alone

### Step 15: Evidence Integration
- **Thinking Prompt**: "For each key assertion or recommendation, identify the specific evidence that supports it. Ensure claims are properly substantiated and limitations acknowledged."
- **Framework Application**: Apply the Evidence-Based Argumentation framework
- **Output**: Well-supported insights with transparent evidence base

## PHASE 6: QUALITY ASSURANCE

### Step 16: Logic Flow Validation
- **Thinking Prompt**: "Review the entire analysis for logical consistency. Do conclusions follow naturally from premises? Are there any unfounded leaps in reasoning? Are counterarguments addressed?"
- **Framework Application**: Apply McKinsey's Logic Flow Assessment
- **Output**: Logically sound and coherent analysis

### Step 17: Multiple Perspective Validation
- **Thinking Prompt**: "Review the analysis from different stakeholder perspectives. Have alternative viewpoints been fairly represented? Are there biases in the analysis that should be addressed?"
- **Framework Application**: Use EY's Balanced Perspective Assessment
- **Output**: Balanced and comprehensive analysis

### Step 18: Limitation Acknowledgment
- **Thinking Prompt**: "Explicitly identify the limitations of this analysis. What uncertainties remain? What assumptions were made? What additional research would strengthen the conclusions?"
- **Framework Application**: Apply the Transparency Protocol
- **Output**: Honest assessment of limitations and areas for further research

## LLM-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE

### Managing Reasoning Chains
- Break complex analyses into distinct reasoning steps
- Explicitly track intermediate conclusions
- Periodically summarize progress to maintain focus

### Mitigating Hallucination Risk
- Clearly distinguish between established facts, reasonable inferences, and speculative thinking
- When uncertain about specific data points, acknowledge the uncertainty rather than fabricating details
- Use structured frameworks to guide thinking rather than generating unconstrained narratives

### Leveraging Multi-Perspective Thinking
- Deliberately consider contrarian viewpoints
- Simulate diverse stakeholder perspectives
- Apply different analytical lenses to the same problem

### Maintaining Coherence
- Periodically revisit the core research question to maintain focus
- Create explicit connections between different sections of analysis
- Ensure recommendations directly address the identified insights

## EXECUTION TEMPLATE

For each phase of the research process, follow this execution pattern:

1. **Frame**: Clearly state what you aim to accomplish in this phase
2. **Think**: Use the specific thinking prompts to guide your reasoning process
3. **Apply**: Apply the relevant analytical frameworks 
4. **Synthesize**: Integrate the findings into a coherent output
5. **Transition**: Create a logical bridge to the next phase

By following this structured process, you will produce research insight papers that combine analytical rigor, strategic relevance, and practical utility while leveraging the unique capabilities of large language models.
