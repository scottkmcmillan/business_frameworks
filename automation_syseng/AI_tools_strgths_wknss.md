Windsurf w/ Cascade
- preferred workflow but only has Gemini Flash which does not do multi-step reasoning like Gemini Deep Research models do.
- can not up

Gemini Deep Research - multi step reasoning but does not have a built-in workflow like Windsurf does. Can't upload documents to add to prompts or reference documents in google drive. Can review publicly available documents on the web though.

Notebook LM - ok workflow but does not have a document creation function like i can do in Windsurf. Also limited to Gemini Flash.
